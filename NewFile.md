# Use comment to collaborate asynchronously <i class="fa fa-commenting-o"></i>

You can join the discussion using Comments <i class="fa fa-commenting-o"></i>. 
While HackMD does best in real-time collaboration, some contributions happen asynchronously. Comment is best for these use cases.

## Write comment
Writing a comment is easy: select the text you want to comment on and hit the **<i class="fa fa-commenting"></i> Comment** button that pops up. Leave the comment on the right-hand side comment area.

## View comment
Comments are attached to the text commented, with the text background highlighted. 
Click on the text or the <i class="fa fa-commenting-o"></i> icon at the end of the line to view the comment. Click anywhere else to toggle it off.

Overlapped comments will have darker shade of color.
